# Low Seeder Count Fix - Complete Solution

## üéØ Problem Analysis
Based on your screenshots:
- **Desktop Jackett**: Shows 716, 184, 164, 116+ seeders
- **Telegram Bot**: Shows only 44, 9, 9 seeders

This indicates the bot is using different/fewer indexers than your desktop setup.

## üîß Root Cause & Solution

### 1. **Limited Indexer Configuration**
**Problem**: Bot was only using 5 basic indexers by default
```
OLD: "yts,nyaa,eztv,limetorrents,linuxtracker"
```

**Solution**: Expanded to 10 popular indexers matching desktop configs
```
NEW: "yts,nyaa,eztv,limetorrents,linuxtracker,1337x,thepiratebay,rarbg,torrentgalaxy,glodls"
```

### 2. **Added Diagnostic Tools**
**New Command**: `/tdiag` - Test indexer performance
- Shows which indexers are configured in Jackett
- Tests each indexer individually
- Reports results count and top seeder counts
- Identifies failing indexers

### 3. **Enhanced Rich Mode**
**Improvement**: Rich mode now queries ALL available indexers from Jackett
- Automatically discovers configured indexers
- No longer limited to hardcoded list
- Uses whatever you have configured in desktop Jackett

### 4. **Better Error Reporting**
- Shows which indexers failed and why
- Suggests running diagnostics
- Provides actionable troubleshooting steps

## üìä How to Use

### Step 1: Run Diagnostics
```
/tdiag
```
This will show you:
- Which indexers are available in your Jackett
- Which ones are working vs failing
- Seeder counts from each indexer
- Performance comparison

### Step 2: Use Rich Mode for Maximum Coverage
```
/t alice cooper rich
```
This will:
- Query ALL your configured Jackett indexers
- Show real-time progress
- Return up to 15 results (vs 5 in normal mode)
- Match your desktop results

### Step 3: Configure More Indexers (if needed)
Set environment variable to match your desktop:
```yaml
environment:
  - JACKETT_INDEXERS=yts,nyaa,eztv,limetorrents,linuxtracker,1337x,thepiratebay,rarbg,torrentgalaxy,glodls,jackett
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After this fix:
1. **Normal Search**: Will use 10 indexers instead of 5
2. **Rich Search**: Will use ALL your Jackett indexers
3. **Higher Seeders**: Should match or approach desktop results
4. **Diagnostics**: Can identify and fix indexer issues

## üîç Troubleshooting

If results are still low:

1. **Check indexer status**: `/tdiag`
2. **Verify Jackett config**: Ensure indexers are configured and working
3. **Use rich mode**: `/t <query> rich` for maximum coverage
4. **Check timeouts**: Increase `READ_TIMEOUT` if indexers are slow
5. **Add more indexers**: Update `JACKETT_INDEXERS` environment variable

## üìà Performance Comparison

| Mode | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Normal | 5 indexers | 10 indexers |
| Rich | Hardcoded list | ALL available |
| Results | Up to 5 | Up to 15 (rich) |
| Diagnostics | None | Full testing |

The bot should now provide results much closer to your desktop Jackett interface! üöÄ
