# ✅ `/d clear` Feature Implementation Complete

## 🗑️ Successfully Implemented Clear Function

The `/d clear` command has been **successfully implemented** in `plugins/downloads.py` and is ready to use!

### ✅ What Works
- **Core Functionality**: `_delete_completed_torrents()` function implemented ✅
- **Command Integration**: `/d clear` command integrated into `show()` function ✅  
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies completed torrents (progress >= 99.9%) ✅

- **User Feedback**: Shows count and names of deleted torrents ✅
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of deletion failures ✅

### 🔧 How It Works

**Command Usage:**
```
/d clear
```

**What It Does:**
1. **Scans** all torrents in qBittorrent
2. **Identifies** fully completed torrents (100% progress)
3. **Deletes** both the torrent entry and downloaded files
4. **Reports** how many were deleted and their names

**Example Output:**
```
🗑️ Clearing all completed torrents...

✅ Successfully cleared 3 completed torrent(s):

🗑️ Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop amd64.iso
🗑️ Movie.2023.1080p.BluRay.x264
🗑️ Album.Artist.FLAC

... and 2 more
```

### 💡 Key Features

**Smart Detection:**
- Uses `progress >= 0.999` to account for floating point precision
- Only deletes truly completed downloads
- Leaves active/partial downloads untouched

**Complete Cleanup:**
- `delete_files=True` removes actual downloaded files
- Frees up disk space immediately
- Cleans both qBittorrent database and filesystem

**User-Friendly Feedback:**
- Shows exactly what was deleted
- Truncates long lists (shows first 5, then "... and X more")
- Reports if no completed torrents found

1. **No Setup Required**: Works with existing qBittorrent configuration
2. **Safe Operation**: Only affects 100% completed torrents
3. **Immediate Effect**: Frees disk space instantly
4. **Error Tolerant**: Continues even if some deletions fail

### 📝 Commands Overview

```
/d                     # List all downloads
