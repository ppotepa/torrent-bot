# Seeder Sorting Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified
Users reported that torrent search results were not properly sorted by seeders in descending order, with desktop results showing higher seeder counts than the bot results.

## 🔧 Root Causes Found

1. **Inconsistent Data Types**: Different Jackett indexers return seeder counts in various formats:
   - Some return integers: `"Seeders": 150`
   - Some return strings: `"Seeders": "25"`
   - Some use different field names: `"seeders"`, `"Seeds"`, `"seed_count"`
   - Some include text: `"Seeders": "12 seeders"`

2. **Multiple Sorting Points**: Results were sorted at different stages but not consistently with the same logic

3. **Field Name Variations**: Different indexers use different JSON field names for seeder counts

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Robust Seeder Extraction Function
```python
def get_seeders_count(result):
    """Extract and normalize seeders count from various indexer formats"""
```
- Handles multiple field names: `Seeders`, `seeders`, `Seeds`, `seeds`, `seed_count`, `SeedCount`
- Converts strings to integers safely
- Removes non-numeric characters from string values
- Ensures non-negative values (converts negative to 0)
- Returns 0 as fallback for missing/invalid data

### 2. Centralized Sorting Function
```python
def sort_results_by_seeders(results):
    """Sort torrent results by seeders count in descending order"""
```
- Uses the robust seeder extraction function
- Secondary sort by title for consistent ordering
- Includes debug logging to help troubleshoot future issues
- Returns properly sorted results (highest seeders first)

### 3. Updated All Sorting Points
- `search_jackett_fast()`: Now uses `sort_results_by_seeders()`
- `search_jackett_extended()`: Updated seeder checking and sorting
- `search_jackett_rich()`: Uses robust sorting
- `start_search()`: Final sort before display to ensure correct order
- Display logic: Uses `get_seeders_count()` for consistent values

### 4. Enhanced Display
- Button seeders: Now shows correct extracted values
- Result list: Uses normalized seeder counts
- Quality indicators: Based on properly extracted seeders

## 🧪 Testing
Created `test_seeders.py` to verify the extraction handles various formats:
- Integer values: `150` → `150`
- String numbers: `"25"` → `25`  
- Lowercase fields: `"seeders": 5` → `5`
- Different field names: `"Seeds": 75` → `75`
- String with text: `"12 seeders"` → `12`
- Missing fields: `None` → `0`
- Negative values: `-1` → `0`

## 📈 Expected Results

After this fix, users should see:
1. **Consistent Sorting**: All results properly ordered by seeder count (highest first)
2. **Accurate Counts**: Correct seeder numbers displayed in both results and buttons
3. **Better Quality**: High-seeder torrents always appear at the top
4. **Debug Info**: Console logs show sorting verification (can be disabled in production)

## 🎛 Configuration

No new environment variables needed. The fix is backward compatible and improves existing functionality.

## 🔍 Debug Information

The sorting function now logs the top 5 results to help verify correct ordering:
```
🔍 Sorted 8 results by seeders:
  1. 150 seeders - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop
  2. 75 seeders - Linux Mint 21 Cinnamon
  3. 25 seeders - Fedora 37 Workstation
  ...
```

This ensures that the bot now matches or exceeds desktop client sorting accuracy!
