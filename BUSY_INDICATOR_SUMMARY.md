# Busy Indicator Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Issue:** After users typed a number to select a torrent, there was a long pause with no feedback while the system processed the selection, causing confusion and uncertainty.

**Solution:** Added an immediate busy indicator that appears instantly when a user makes a selection, providing clear feedback about what's happening during processing.

## ⚡ **Implementation Details**

### **Modified File: `bot.py`**

Added busy indicator to the number selection handler:

```python
@bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: message.text and message.text.isdigit() and 1 <= int(message.text) <= 50)
def handle_torrent_number_selection(message):
    # ... validation code ...
    
    # Show busy indicator immediately
    busy_msg = bot.send_message(
        message.chat.id,
        f"⏳ **Processing selection {selected_number}...**\n"
        f"🧲 Adding torrent to qBittorrent\n"
        f"📁 Setting up download folder\n"
        f"🚀 Starting download...",
        parse_mode="Markdown"
    )
    
    try:
        # Process the selection...
        torrent.handle_selection(bot, mock_call)
    except Exception as e:
        bot.reply_to(message, f"❌ Error processing selection: {e}")
    finally:
        # Always clean up the busy indicator
        try:
            bot.delete_message(message.chat.id, busy_msg.message_id)
        except Exception:
            pass  # Ignore deletion failures
```

### **Key Features:**

1. **Instant Feedback:** Busy indicator appears immediately when user types a number
2. **Clear Messaging:** Shows exactly what steps are happening
3. **Markdown Formatting:** Bold text for professional appearance
4. **Automatic Cleanup:** Busy message is always deleted after processing
5. **Error Resilient:** Handles both processing errors and cleanup failures gracefully

## 🚀 **User Experience Improvement**

### **Before:**
```

User: "2"
Bot: "⏳ Processing selection 2...
      🧲 Adding torrent to qBittorrent
      📁 Setting up download folder
      🚀 Starting download..."
[Processing happens with clear status]
Bot: "✅ Download started!" (busy indicator auto-deleted)
```
