## 🎯 Issue: Telegram API Error 400 - Markdown Parsing
```
❌ Audiobook command error: A request to the Telegram API was unsuccessful. 
Error code: 400. Description: Bad Request: can't parse entities: 
Can't find end of the entity starting at byte offset 161

Command: /ab Artur, wiesz co to oznacza?:[inline,pl,enhanced_sapi]
```

## 🔧 Solution Applied
**Fixed corrupted unicode emoji in Markdown messages** by:
1. Removed `parse_mode="Markdown"` from problematic bot replies
2. Fixed malformed emoji bytes (`�`) in f-strings
3. Cleaned up formatting to use plain text

## ✅ Result: WORKING!
```bash
🎭 Converting: 'Artur, wiesz co to oznacza?'
✅ Success! Generated 130,544 bytes
📁 File: audiobooks/Artur_wiesz_co_to_oznacza_pl_enhanced_sapi.mp3
```

## 🚀 Your Polish command now works perfectly:
```
/ab Artur, wiesz co to oznacza?:[inline,pl,enhanced_sapi]
```
